# koana

## Install deps

`npm i babel tape`

## Solving problems

Run the solution files using the node executable
as you normally would. They should be structured like
this (In ES6):

```node
import * from 'koana'

koana.set('Linked Lists')

// See the relevant documentation for each problem
// to know which arguments to accept in your signatures.
koana.solution(1, function(scope) {

})
```
